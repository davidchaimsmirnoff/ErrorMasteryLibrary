what other ways you can understand bindings with errors like we were saying befoer how manny errors recreated would you need btw

Got it — you want the bigger picture:
Not just TDZ, but all the different ways variable bindings behave, and how we can learn them by breaking things on purpose and then fixing them.

If we’re talking about really understanding bindings (creation, initialization, scope, shadowing, redeclaration rules, etc.), you’d probably need around 15–20 targeted errors.
That’s enough to hit every unique rule that comes from the spec’s handling of bindings — without endless repetition.

🔹 Binding Errors to Recreate and Fix
1–8: TDZ family (already covered above)

Access let before initialization

Access const before initialization

Access class before initialization

Shadowing creates new TDZ (outer variable exists but hidden)

typeof in TDZ throws

Default parameter referencing later let

TDZ in switch case

TDZ in catch shadowing

9–12: Redeclaration and reassignment

Redeclare let in same scope

let a = 1;
let a = 2; // ❌ SyntaxError


Redeclare const in same scope

Redeclare var over let/const in same scope

let b = 1;
var b = 2; // ❌ SyntaxError


Reassign const

const x = 1;
x = 2; // ❌ TypeError

13–15: Scope visibility

Access a block-scoped variable from outside

{
  let hidden = 123;
}
console.log(hidden); // ❌ ReferenceError


Access function parameter outside function

Access var from outside its function → ReferenceError

16–17: Shadowing logic bugs

Shadowing in nested blocks hides outer value unexpectedly

Shadowing in parameters hides outer value unexpectedly

18–19: Function vs variable conflicts

Function declaration overwritten by var

function f() {}
var f = 5;
f(); // ❌ TypeError


Function parameter name conflicts with let inside → SyntaxError

20: Lexical scope confusion

Attempting to access variable before function call where it’s declared inside → ReferenceError (not TDZ, just out of scope).

Why this set works

TDZ errors (1–8) → You deeply internalize the uninitialized binding state.

Redeclaration/reassignment errors (9–12) → You learn the one-binding-per-scope rule and const immutability.

Scope visibility errors (13–15) → You feel how scope boundaries actually hide variables.

Shadowing logic bugs (16–17) → You learn how new bindings can unexpectedly hide others.

Function-binding conflicts (18–19) → You see how different binding types can collide.

Lexical scope limits (20) → You get clear on "out of scope" vs TDZ.

If you recreate all 20 in a “binding error lab” and then fix them, you’ll understand:

When bindings exist (creation phase)

When they become usable (initialization)

Where they’re visible (scope rules)

What happens when you redeclare, shadow, or overwrite

How hoisting + TDZ + scope actually interact in real code

If you want, I can build you a single file where each of these errors runs in sequence with a label, so you can watch the exact messages and then the fixed version. That’s the fastest way to master bindings through errors.

Do you want me to put that lab together?
