how many errors would you have to recreate and solve in order to know expo client 
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 25s

Short answer: if you deliberately recreate and fix about 25 distinct error patterns, you’ll feel fluent with Expo Client. Hit 12 to be productive, 25 for confidence, and ~35 (including EAS builds & push) for “nothing scares me” level.

Here’s a tight roadmap you can follow:

Milestones
'''
Level 1 (12 errors): you can run locally on device/simulator and fix common Metro hiccups.

Level 2 (25 errors): you handle navigation, permissions, networking, assets, Expo Go limits, and config pitfalls.

Level 3 (35 errors): you master EAS build/submit, credentials, OTA updates, and store quirks.

The 25-core “error patterns” to master

Env & CLI (7)

Node/CLI mismatch (old expo-cli vs npx expo)

Expo SDK ↔ Expo Go version mismatch

Android SDK not found / ANDROID_HOME wrong

iOS simulator/device not detected

Watchman/macos permissions/watch limits

Yarn/npm lockfile conflicts

PATH issues on Windows (PowerShell vs Git Bash)

Metro & Bundling (6)
8) “Cannot find entry file index.js/App.js”
9) Metro cache poisoning / haste map stuck
10) Module resolution with @/tsconfig paths not set
11) Non-transpiled dependency needs Babel include
12) SVG/asset importing errors (require() vs expo-image/react-native-svg)
13) Dynamic import/URL assets failing in production

Navigation & State (4)
14) undefined is not an object (evaluating route.params…)
15) React Navigation container not mounted / linking not configured
16) Double effects from React StrictMode (stale closures)
17) Gesture-handler/native-stack not installed/registered

Networking & Device (4)
18) Android emulator localhost issue (needs 10.0.2.2)
19) iOS simulator hitting your machine via http://127.0.0.1 vs device over LAN
20) CORS / mixed-content (HTTP vs HTTPS)
21) WebSockets/Expo Dev tunnels flaking (LAN vs Tunnel vs Local)

Permissions & Native APIs (4)
22) Camera/Media/Location permissions not requested or not in config
23) Notifications: missing config or device token not obtained in Expo Go
24) Background tasks not registered in app.json/App lifecycle
25) Linking/deep links: missing custom scheme and intentFilters

Stretch (add 10 to reach 35)

EAS & Releases:

App ID/package mismatch, keystore/profiles missing, entitlements wrong

google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist not bundled

Runtime version mismatch so OTA updates don’t apply

Asset sizes & store metadata failures

iOS capabilities (Push, Background modes) not enabled

expo-updates misconfig (no update URL, wrong channel)

Hermes on/off mismatches causing crash at startup

react-native-reanimated Babel plugin missing

Build failing on native modules not supported in Expo Go

App Store/Play Console submission errors (icons, screenshots, privacy)

How to practice (fast loop)

For each pattern do:

Reproduce: intentionally break it (e.g., change SDK in app.json to a non-supported value).

Observe: read the exact error text; screenshot it.

Fix: apply the minimal, correct change.

Note: write a 2–3 line “symptom → cause → fix” card.

If you want, I can spin up a compact checklist with 25 mini “break & fix” drills (each with how to break, expected error message, and fix steps).
