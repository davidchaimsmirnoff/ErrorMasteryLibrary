could you understand it some how by like passing more errors though? if yes what errors would you need how much and what are they?

Totally—you can “learn hoisting by breaking it.” Here’s a compact error lab: ~18 core mistakes that, if you recreate and fix them, will make the two-phase model (creation vs execution + TDZ) click.

Core TDZ & Hoisting Errors (with quick fixes)

TDZ with let

console.log(a);         // ❌ ReferenceError
let a = 1;


Fix:

let a = 1; console.log(a);


Lesson: let is hoisted but uninitialized → TDZ before the line.

TDZ with const

console.log(b);         // ❌ ReferenceError
const b = 2;


Fix: declare first (and initialize).

var pre-access = undefined

console.log(x);         // ✅ undefined (surprise, not error)
var x = 10;


Fix: move use after init to avoid confusion.
Lesson: var hoisted and initialized to undefined.

typeof isn’t safe in TDZ

console.log(typeof z);  // ❌ ReferenceError
let z = 3;


Fix: declare first.

Shadowing creates a new TDZ

let n = 1;
(function () {
  console.log(n);       // ❌ ReferenceError (inner TDZ)
  let n = 2;
})();


Fix: move the log below the inner let.

Function declaration vs expression

foo();                  // ✅ works (hoisted declaration)
bar();                  // ❌ TypeError: bar is not a function
function foo() {}
var bar = function() {};


Fix: call bar after assignment (or use a declaration).

let function expression in TDZ

baz();                  // ❌ ReferenceError
let baz = function(){};


Fix: declare before call.

Default params referencing later let

function f(a = b) { return a; }
let b = 5;
f();                    // ❌ ReferenceError


Fix: define b first, then define f.

Classes are TDZ too

new C();                // ❌ ReferenceError
class C {}


Fix: declare class first.

const must be initialized

const k;                // ❌ SyntaxError


Fix: const k = 0;

Reassignment of const

const k = 1;
k = 2;                  // ❌ TypeError


Fix: use let if it must change.

Redeclaration with let/const

let m = 1;
let m = 2;              // ❌ SyntaxError: already declared


Fix: assign, don’t redeclare.

Block scope leak with var (logic bug)

if (true) { var t = 1; }
console.log(t);         // ✅ 1 (might be unintended)


Fix: use let for block scoping.

Loop closure bug with var

var fns = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) fns.push(() => console.log(i));
fns[0](); fns[1](); fns[2]();  // 3, 3, 3


Fix: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) … → 0,1,2.

Name collision: function vs var

function g() { return 'fn'; }
var g = 1;
console.log(typeof g);  // "number" (function overwritten)
g();                    // ❌ TypeError


Fix: avoid reusing names (or use let/const in separate block).

Temporal order in nested blocks

{
  console.log(a);       // ❌ ReferenceError (TDZ of inner a)
  let a = 1;
}


Fix: move access below declaration.

Switch creates one block (shadowing TDZ)

let out = 0;
switch (1) {
  case 1:
    console.log(out);   // ❌ ReferenceError (if you redeclare below)
    let out = 2;
}


Fix: don’t redeclare; use a different name or move code.

catch binding shadowing

let e = 'outer';
try { throw 1; } catch (e) {
  console.log(e);       // 1
  // console.log(eBefore); // try referencing outer e here (ok), but
  // redeclaring `let e` again inside will error
}


Experiment: Redeclare inside catch and observe errors.
Lesson: catch (e) introduces a new block-scoped binding.

How to use this lab

Run each Fail in Node or your browser console; read the exact error.

Then apply the Fix and re-run.

After you finish all 18, the creation/execution phases + TDZ will feel natural.

If you want, I can bundle these into a single guided script that prints EXPECTED vs ACTUAL, pauses between steps, and links each failure to the specific hoisting rule it demonstrates.
